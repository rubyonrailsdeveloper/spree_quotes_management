  [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/vinsol-spree-contrib/spree-demo-heroku/tree/spree-qoutes-management-3-4)

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

  #### Spree >= 3.2

  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_quotes_management', github: 'vinsol-spree-contrib/spree-quotes-management'
  ```

  #### Spree < 3.2

  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_quotes_management', github: 'vinsol-spree-contrib/spree-quotes-management', branch: 'X-X-stable'
  ```

  The `branch` option is important: it must match the version of Spree you're using.
  For example, use `3-0-stable` if you're using Spree `3-0-stable` or any `3.0.x` version.


2. Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

  ```shell
    bundle
    bundle exec rails g spree_quotes_management:install
  ```

## Working

### New Quotes by client:

  1. Logged in user can submit quote from home page, in 'How was your experience with us?' form.
  2. User can leave the 'Quoted By' field to submit quote as anonymous user.

### Admin Management Interface:
  1. Admin can view all quotes in Admin Panel -> Quotes tab.
  2. Admin can publish/un-publish quotes from there.
  3. Admin can edit any quote by clicking on Edit button.

## Testing

  #### Spree >= 3.1

  For Building Dependencies:
  ```shell
  appraisal install
  ```

  The dummy app can be regenerated by using:
  ```shell
  appraisal spree-3-1 rake test_app

  ```
  This will run rake test_app using the dependencies configured for Spree 3.1. Similarly you can use spree-3-2 and spree-master for generating dummy applications using dependencies for Spree 3.2 and latest version of Spree


  ```shell
  appraisal spree-3-1 rspec
  ```
  This will run rspec using the dependencies configured for Spree 3.1. Similarly you can use spree-3-2 and spree-master to run rspec using dependencies for Spree 3.2 and latest version of Spree


  #### Spree 3.0 and Spree 2.x

  First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

  ```shell
  bundle
  bundle exec rspec spec
  ```
